//Access Modifiers:

//Public: When you declare a variable or a method as public in a class, it signifies that it can be accessed throughout the class. You can access these variables and methods from other classes as well
//Private: When you declare a variable as private in a class, it signifies that it can be accessed throughout the class but not outside of it.

/*Getter and Setters:
    used for accessing private variables of the class. Does it make private variable to Public? No beacuse we can have sanity checking or contraints that 
    can be put into setter methods so that variables are assigned only when the pass sanity check.*/

/*Encapsulation is a principle based on hiding the state of objects and restricting their access to various parts of your program. 
    Encapsulation is achieved with the use of private access modifiers and the getter and setter methods.*/

// Abstraction vs Encapsulation
/*Abstraction concept makes code more user friendly by hiding implementation part of the class, which makes program more robust where user can use class without thinking of its implementation.    

whereas Encapsulation restricts access for  class variables and methods from  outside the class, which makes program more secure*/
